# ML Template 
Python ML code template for personal use

## Getting Started

* Create New Conda Environment

```
# Python 2.7
$ conda create -n tensorflow python=2.7

# Python 3.4
$ conda create -n tensorflow python=3.4

# Python 3.5. I am using this
$ conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5

```

* Activate conda environment 

```
$ activate tensorflow
```

* Install the Packages

```
$ conda install theano 

$ conda install tensorflow 

$ conda install keras 

#Install Editor, spyder in this case
$ conda install spyder

#Install other necessary libraries 
$ pip install matplotlib 

$ pip install pandas 

$ pip install sklearn

#Make sure to update the libraries 
$ pip install -U tensorflow

```

Alternatively you can also try 

```
# Installing Theano
$ pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git

# Installing Tensorflow
# Install Tensorflow from the website: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html

# Installing Keras
#conda install -c anaconda scipy
$ pip install --upgrade keras


``` 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
